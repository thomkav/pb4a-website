## Technical Approach

### Why Not WordPress or Site Builders?

I've intentionally chosen a modern static site architecture over WordPress or traditional site builders for several important reasons:

1. **Security**: Static sites have virtually no attack surface - no database to hack, no login vulnerabilities, no plugin exploits
2. **Performance**: Lightning-fast load times improve user experience and SEO
3. **Reliability**: No server-side failures, no database crashes - just simple, reliable HTML/CSS
4. **Cost**: Free hosting on Netlify (vs. monthly WordPress hosting fees)
5. **Maintenance**: No WordPress core updates, plugin updates, or compatibility issues
6. **Developer-Friendly**: Modern tooling (11ty + Tailwind CSS) means cleaner code and easier long-term maintenance

WordPress and site builders were designed for an earlier era of the web. For a straightforward informational site like yours, they're overkill and introduce unnecessary complexity, security risks, and costs.

### Self-Service Content Management

While we're not using WordPress, **you'll still be able to edit content yourself** through Netlify CMS:

- **Admin Interface**: Once we enable Netlify Identity, you'll access a visual editor at `yoursite.com/admin/`
- **No Technical Skills Required**: Add pages, edit text, and manage content through forms - no code editing needed
- **Version Control**: All changes are tracked in Git, providing a full history and easy rollback if needed
- **Team Access**: Multiple team members can be given editor access

This gives you the convenience of a CMS without the baggage of WordPress.

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: 11ty (Eleventy) - Fast, flexible static site generator
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - Modern utility-first CSS framework
- **Hosting**: Netlify - Industry-leading static hosting with automatic deployments
- **CMS**: Netlify CMS - Git-based content management
- **Version Control**: GitHub - Professional source control and collaboration

## Next Steps

To move forward, I need the following from your team:

### 1. Domain Selection
- **Decision Needed**: Choose between `.com` ($14.99/yr after first year) or `.org` ($10.99 first year, $19.99/yr after)
- **Purchase Option A**: Purchase domain from any registrar (Namecheap, Google Domains, GoDaddy, etc.) and provide me with DNS access
- **Purchase Option B**: I can register and manage the domain through Netlify on your behalf (requires upfront payment to me or direct Netlify payment)
